## **The Edge**

Google Trends shows you what's already trending. Too late—competition is high.

But high-traffic sites? Their sitemaps are early indicators. When they add new pages for emerging topics, it happens *before* trends become obvious.

**The insight:** When multiple successful sites update their sitemaps with pages about the same topic within days—that's your signal. Act while the window is open.

```

**What you get:**

- Daily sitemap diff reports—exact URLs added from monitored sites
- Shared pool of curated high-traffic domains (already tracking)
- Pattern detection when multiple sites move on the same topic
- Submit domains to add to the monitoring pool

**The advantage:** Piggyback on the research of successful operators. They spot trends, you see their moves, you act first.

## **Example**

You're monitoring 20 game sites. Three of them add pages for a new game to their sitemaps within 48 hours.

That's not random. They identified something early.

**Your move:** Check the keyword. Still low competition? Build and launch while Google Trends shows zero data.

This works in any niche where content moves fast.
